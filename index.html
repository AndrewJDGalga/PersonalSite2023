                    <p>
                        Website completed for the Austin, Texas based board game design group ATX Game Designers for the final Practicum portion of my Austin Community College Web Development coursework. ATX Game Designers asked me to make a static site in Wordpress on a server they control. I had almost no experience with PHP or Wordpress at that point. I created a Classic-style theme and added site content directly in Wordpress.

                    <p>
                        In order to complete my course, I was later asked to rebuild the front and game gallery pages from scratch using HTML, Vanilla JS, and CSS. I completed the rebuild of these pages, including the creation of a custom image carousel, in 10 days.
